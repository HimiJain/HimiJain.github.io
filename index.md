# About Me

I recently completed my masters in Computer Science at IIT Madras, and have now joined Flipkart. My research work is about cache timing side-channel attacks on cryptographic algorithms, and it proposes the optimisations of such timing attacks on the processorâ€™s last level cache memory (LLC). I also like spending my time making art and craftworks.
